# 👋 Welcome to Jahmeer Jones’ Research Archive

Welcome to my knowledge vault, the backbone of my fight to expose Donald Trump’s catastrophic second term. I’m Jahmeer Jones, aka Jahrix, a progressive debater and content creator tracking Trump’s lies, power grabs, and economic flops. This archive powers my YouTube videos, live debates, and social posts, built for clarity, receipts, and real-time takedowns
