# 🗣️ Debate Notes – Master Thread

This folder houses all debate prep, breakdowns, rebuttals, and post-debate debriefs. Whether it's formal debates, YouTube panels, or off-the-cuff Twitter beef, this is where the *ammo* lives.

## 🧱 Structure

- Each debate = its own file  
- Notes include:
  - ✅ Debate summary
  - ✅ My position (framed clearly)
  - ✅ Opponent’s main arguments
  - ✅ Rebuttals (with sources)
  - ✅ Timestamped clips (if available)
  - ✅ Post-debate reflection or lessons learned

---

## 🧰 Tools I Use

- `#debate` – Tag for all debate prep
- `#panel` – Tag for panel-style discussions
- `#react` – For clips or segments I responded to
- Dataview used for listing & sorting debates by date
