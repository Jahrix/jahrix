## Trump is A Liar

>If you’re betting on Trump to tell the truth, odds are 3 to 1 you’ll be disappointed. **[PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/)’s data shows that about [76% of his claims are misleading or outright false](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/)**. Meanwhile, [Joe Biden has a 59%/41%](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/joe-biden/) Truth to Lie score.

## Trump is Lazy

> Donald Trump has offered little in the way of substantive policy, yet he’s already spent **38 out of 162 days—nearly 23.5% of his presidency—on the golf course**, according to [DidTrumpGolfToday.com](https://didtrumpgolftoday.com/). These trips have cost American taxpayers **an estimated $51.8 million**.

## Trump's OBBB (One Big Beautiful Bill) 

This is a breakdown of **Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”**, with a special focus on how it affects **everyday Americans** making under $360,000/year — including working-class families, young professionals, and middle-income earners.

> **Spoiler**: The top-line tax breaks sound nice. But when you dig deeper, you’ll see this bill mostly **benefits the ultra-wealthy** and corporations, while making life harder for regular people.
