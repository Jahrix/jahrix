## Introduction
**Jeffrey Edward Epstein** was an American financier and convicted sex offender born on January 20th, 1953, and was an American financier whose 2019 death in federal custody sparked widespread controversy, conspiracy theories, and international media scrutiny. Known for his connections to powerful figures in politics, business, and entertainment, Epstein was at the center of a sprawling investigation into child sex trafficking. His death, officially ruled a suicide, raised serious questions due to irregularities at the Manhattan jail where he was being held, including malfunctioning surveillance cameras and the failure of guards to perform regular checks. Central to ongoing public interest is the so-called _Epstein List,_ a rumored collection of names allegedly linked to his criminal activities, which many believe could lead to one of the most significant expos√©s of elite corruption in modern history.

### Not The First Time
Jeffrey was arrested on June 27th and charged in Florida on June 30th, 2008. This goes back to 2005 when the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl who attends Royal Palm Beach High School reported to police on the island of Palm Beach that her stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The stepmother tells a detective that "supposedly the man has a lot of money and often has young girls come to his house." The girl, in tears, tells the detective that she was taken upstairs to give Jeffrey a massage. When Jeffrey came into the room wearing only a towel, he sternly told the girl to take her clothes off. She stripped down to her bra and a thong. As she massaged him, he masturbated. Afterward, he paid her $300. The next day, she got into a fight at school after another girl called her a prostitute. On October 20th, Jeffrey's home at 358 El Brillo Way is searched, and what's missing are several computers.
