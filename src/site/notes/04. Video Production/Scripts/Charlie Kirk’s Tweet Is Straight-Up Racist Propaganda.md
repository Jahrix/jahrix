> “Charlie Kirk just tweeted: _‘24 years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim Socialist is on pace to run New York City.’_
> You hear that? He’s literally tying a **Muslim American politician** — born **years after 9/11** — to **terrorists** who murdered Americans.
> That’s not journalism. That’s bigotry dressed up as nationalism.
> What Charlie’s saying is: ‘Because some Muslims did a horrific thing, no Muslim — ever — should lead anything in America.’
> Imagine saying: _“24 years ago a white man shot up a church… now a white Christian is running for governor.”_
> You’d call that racist. Because it **is.**
> Zohran Mamdani isn’t a terrorist. He’s a **democratically elected** official who supports housing rights and public transit.
> If that scares you more than Charlie Kirk’s open religious discrimination…
> maybe you’re not pro-America — you’re just anti-Muslim.”
