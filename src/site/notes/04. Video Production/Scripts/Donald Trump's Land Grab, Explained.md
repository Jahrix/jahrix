# Introduction

[b-roll of Trump saying he wants Greenland]

Speaker: How did we get here? 

[clips of Trump being elected the 47th president.]

Speaker: it's not even January 20th. With Trump being elected, discussion of him purchasing Greenland, a country owned by Denmark with a population of 56k people which is closer to my neighboring city of Saint Cloud, FL. Why does Trump want Greenland, Canada, Panama & Mexico? Lets start off with Greenland

**Part 2: Greenland**
*In 1867, the Alaskan Purchase that gave us Alaska, our manifest destiny was at an all time high. [According to Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, President Harry S. Truman offered to purchase Greenland for 100 million dollars.](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1876754581792985546) Hold on, it says Harry Truman was born 17 years after this claim, so this is a fucking lie. How can anyone Grandparents watch this shit. Greenland is a vast country with many resources such as the black gold, oil. Is this why we want Greenland for oil? Not the first time we've invaded a nation for oil*

[b-roll of american interventions]

[Sherri Goodman is the Secretary General of the International Military Council on Climate and Security and she says Greenland It is a key part of the Arctic region that protects access to the U.S. homeland.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-trump-wants-greenland-and-what-makes-it-a-strategic-polar-outpost)

Greenland has been part of the kingdom of Denmark since 1721, and it is now a self-governing territory but imagine you are a puerto rican and have been dying to become a state but instead of you its greenland. If i was Puerto Rican i would crash out.
