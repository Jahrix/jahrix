## TRUMP ENDS MAIL-IN VOTING.

    - **@atrupar:** [Trump: "Vladimir Putin said something -- one of the most interesting things. He said 'your election was rigged because you have mail in voting.' He said, 'mail in voting, every election -- no country has mail in voting. It's impossible to have mail in voting and have honest elections.' And he said that to me because we talked about 2020. He said, 'you won that election by so much.'"](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1956528296843170112)
