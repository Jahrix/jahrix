## FOX ADMITS PUTIN OWNED TRUMP ON AIR
 - @Acyn: [Fox News Reporter Jacqui Heinrich: The way that it felt in the room was not good. It did not seem like things went well. And it seemed like Putin came in and steamrolled, got right into what he wanted to say and got his photo next to the president and then left](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1956498898488594528)
 
- @Acyn: [Heinrich: And what was really stunning to me as someone who has been in a lot of these press conferences a few things very unusual. You had Putin come out and address the press first. We are on U.S. Soil here](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1956499546445627401)

### FOX TRIES TO DOWNPLAY (ALL HAIL KING TRUMP)
- @Acyn: [Chaffetz: I think it’s a huge win for President Trump and the US… We can push Russia around… That’s why President Trump holds all the cards](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1956505221045383577)
 - @pourteaux: [this is a scandal: american soldiers on their knees, laying Putin’s red carpet](https://x.com/pourteaux/status/1956533483058139140/photo/1)

- @Acyn: [Kellyanne: Do you think Putin wanted to stand on US soil in front of a banner that said Pursuing Peace? Putin treated him like friends. Trump was not being jovial. It's because Putin knows Trump can crush Russia’s economy.](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1956508566682226847)

### TRUMP ON HANNITY (TRUMP 2021!!)

- @atrupar: [Trump: "Vladimir Putin said something -- one of the most interesting things. He said 'your election was rigged because you have mail in voting.' He said, 'mail in voting, every election -- no country has mail in voting. It's impossible to have mail in voting and have honest elections.' And he said that to me because we talked about 2020. He said, 'you won that election by so much.'"](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1956528296843170112)

- @atrupar: [Trump: "Vladimir said just a little while ago, he said 'I've never seen anybody do so much so fast.' He said, 'your country is, like, hot as a pistol,' and a year ago he thought it was dead."](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1956524654866157916)
 - @mehdirhasan: [Child-like behavior from Trump. The guy told him exactly what he wanted to hear, and our narcissistic, thinskinned, insecure leader lapped it up and then repeated it back to the state TV stenographers. Hard to fully comprehend how gullible and easily manipulated Trump is. Amazing](https://x.com/mehdirhasan/status/1956554424677200075)

- @atrupar: [Markwayne Mullin: "President Trump -- possibly the greatest president of all time, definitely of our lifetime. And i's amazing that you and I get to call Mr President, or Mr Trump our friend. It's amazing that he can be just a regular guy and league with such confidence that he does. No one is able to make a deal better than him."](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1956535396050899341)
