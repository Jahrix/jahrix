## Background 
The 1964 Arab League Summit in Cairo initiated the creation of a organization to represent the Palestinian people. The Palestinian Nation Council convened in Jerusalem on May 28, 1964, a couple of days later on the 2nd of June, the PLO was founded.

- Emerged post-[[02. Research Vault/Israel-Palestine/Events/1948 Arab–Israeli War\|1948 Arab–Israeli War]] and [[1948 Nakba \|Nakba]], when ~700,000 Palestinians were displaced.
- Goal: Palestinian self-determination, initially via armed struggle, later diplomacy (e.g., [[02. Research Vault/Israel-Palestine/Events/Oslo Accords\|Oslo Accords]]).
- Operated from Jordan (1964-1971), then Lebanon, Tunisia.

## Important Notes
- PLO’s charter initially called for Israel’s destruction, amended in 1996 to recognize Israel.
- Yasser Arafat’s leadership was polarizing: hero to Palestinians, terrorist to Israel.
- Human angle: PLO represented diaspora Palestinians, many in refugee camps post- [[1948 Nakba \|Nakba]].
