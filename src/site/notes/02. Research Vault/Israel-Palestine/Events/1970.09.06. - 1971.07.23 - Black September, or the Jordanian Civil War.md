### Location
Amman, Zarqa (hijacked planes site), Irbid, Ajlun, and Jerash 

## Causes
### Background
Jordan's demographics were skewed: By 1970, ~2/3 of the population was Palestinian, many refugees from 1948 (Nakba) and 1967 wars, strengthening PLO support. Egyptian President Nasser's pan-Arabism bolstered Palestinians politically. Fedayeen (militants) enclaves evolved into "independent republics" in camps, with checkpoints and taxation, eroding Jordanian authority. Leftist PLO factions (PFLP, DFLP) viewed Hussein as a Western puppet, calling for revolution. Hussein's edict to restrict fedayeen (militants) failed, backed by Nasser but ignored. International factors: Israel promised not to advance if Jordan redeployed border troops; Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait funded fedayeen (militants); 17,000 Iraqi troops in Jordan post-1967 raised intervention fears.

The Tipping Point: 

On June 7, 1970, fedayeen (militants) fired on Hussein's motorcade en route to Mukhabarat HQ. Ceasefire attempts failed as PFLP held 68 hostages in Amman hotels, demanding dismissals of Jordanian commanders. By August, Arafat eyed a Jordanian revolution.

### Events
The war erupted in phases, blending urban guerrilla warfare with conventional battles.  

- **September 6-16, 1970**: Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacks 5 planes (4 successful, 1 foiled). After 371 hostages were removed, three planes landed in Jordan's desert (Dawson's Field), and then they were exploded in front of international press. Hussein declares martial law on September 16 and forms a military government. 

- **September 18**: Jordanian forces shell fedayeen (militants) in Amman, Zarqa, refugee camps; heavy civilian toll. Syria invades with 10,000 troops/300 tanks (PLA markings) toward Irbid to aid the PLO.  

- **September 19-22**: Syrian advance stalls; Jordan appeals for help. US positions Sixth Fleet near coast; Israel mobilizes, flies fighter jets, and uses sonic booms over Syrian troops to deter them.

- **September 27**: Arafat-Hussein ceasefire in Cairo, brokered by Nasser (who dies the next day). The October Amman agreement regulates fedayeen (militants), but violations continue.  
- **October 1970-July 1971**: Jordan pushes fedayeen (militants) from cities (January Irbid clearance); final Ajlun offensive (July) crushes remnants, with 2,000 surrendering. Fedayeen (militants) relocate to Lebanon via Syria.  
Iranian leftists (e.g., OIPFG, MEK) sided with the PLO, bombing Jordan's Tehran embassy during Hussein's visit in revenge.

### Outcome
Jordan expelled the PLO, allowing relocation to Lebanon (via Syria), where they ignited the 1975 Lebanese Civil War. PLO formed the Black September Organization for revenge: Assassinated Jordanian PM Wasfi Tal (1971) for his anti-fedayeen (militants) role. Munich Olympics attack (1972)
