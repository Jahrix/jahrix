#### Facts
United Nations Security Council Resolution 2735 was adopted on June 10, 2024, at the 9650th meeting. This resolution endorses a ceasefire and hostage release plan proposed by the U. S. that consists of three phases, originally outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024. It specifies an immediate halt to hostilities, exchanges involving hostages and prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza, and a long-term reconstruction effort. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of achieving a two-state solution alongside a unified Palestinian governance. The resolution received 14 votes in favor, with Russia choosing to abstain, indicating widespread yet not complete backing.
#### Outcome 
In January 2025, Resolution 2735 led to a ceasefire and a hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas, paving the way for the initial delivery of aid and some troop withdrawals. However, by August 2025, full implementation was still not achieved. The resolution bolstered diplomatic initiatives and received support from the EU and various aid organizations, yet persistent tensions indicate its precarious effectiveness. 
#### Important Notes 
Due to its nature as a non-Chapter VII resolution, UNSC 2735 does not possess binding enforcement capabilities, but it carries considerable diplomatic significance by explicitly opposing territorial changes in Gaza and endorsing a two-state solution. While Hamas embraced the proposal, Israel’s reaction was unclear, revealing divisions within its politics. Russia chose to abstain, citing concerns over the lack of clear enforcement mechanisms, and humanitarian organizations pressed for an immediate increase in aid to avert famine.
