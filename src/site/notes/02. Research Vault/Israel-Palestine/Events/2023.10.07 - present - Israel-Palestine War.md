## Events
### Bombing of the Al-Ahli Hospital 

- On October 17, 2023, news outlets reported a big explosion near Al-Ahli Hospital. Al Jazeera said about 500 people died [Al Jazeera - Photos of Al-Ahli raid](https://web.archive.org/web/20231017204908/https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/10/17/photos-an-israeli-air-raid-on-al-ahli-arab-hospital-kills-an-estimated-500), BBC’s Jeremy Bowen called it a huge blast looking like an Israeli strike [BBC News - Jeremy Bowen report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7T9ZnT-gC4), and Channel 4 questioned Israel’s claim it was a PIJ misfire [Channel 4 - Hospital strike analysis](https://www.mediaite.com/uk/channel-4-news-israel-evidence-gaza-hospital/). NYT also reported around 500 deaths [NYT - Hospital bombing](https://web.archive.org/web/20231017190254/https://www.nytimes.com/).
- Later analysis showed a crater in the parking lot, not the hospital itself, suggesting it wasn’t a big Israeli missile. Human Rights Watch found on November 26, 2023, that it was likely a Palestinian group’s rocket and raised questions about the death toll reported by Hamas [Human Rights Watch - Al-Ahli findings](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/26/gaza-findings-october-17-al-ahli-hospital-explosion).

### Israel bombing "safe zones"

- Reports from UNCHR, HRW, PBS, DOHA News, and VOA News said Israel ordered 1.1 million people to leave northern Gaza in 24 hours, calling it impossible [UNCHR - Evacuation order](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/israel-must-rescind-evacuation-order-northern-gaza-and-comply-international), [HRW - Gaza evacuation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/16/why-israels-gaza-evacuation-order-so-alarming), [PBS - Evacuation news](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-orders-evacuation-of-1-million-in-northern-gaza-in-24-hours), [DOHA News - UN call](https://dohanews.co/un-calls-on-israel-to-rescind-impossible-24-hour-evacuation-order-for-1-million-palestinians/), [VOA News - 24-hour notice](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-un-northern-gaza-should-evacuate-within-24-hours/7309227.html). This came from a UN statement by Stéphane Dujarric [UN Press - Dujarric statement](https://press.un.org/en/2023/db231013.doc.htm).
- Some said Israel bombed southern Gaza after telling people to flee there. On October 13, 2023, Israel dropped pamphlets and posted on social media in Arabic/English warning 1.1 million to leave northern Gaza [IAF - Airdropped warnings](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/hamas-israel-war-october-2023/warning-to-civilians/). No official 24-hour deadline was confirmed; major ground ops started October 27, 2023 [IDF - Operation timeline](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-regarding-the-hamas-israel-war/). No mutual "safe zones" exist as Hamas hasn’t cooperated [IDF - Al-Mawasi declaration](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-regarding-the-hamas-israel-war/october-23-pr/idf-calls-residents-of-gaza-to-evacuate-to-humanitarian-area-in-al-mawasi-where-international-humanitarian-aid-will-be-provided/). Israel declared Al-Mawasi a safe zone on October 18, 2023 [IDF - Al-Mawasi safe zone](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-regarding-the-hamas-israel-war/october-23-pr/idf-calls-residents-of-gaza-to-evacuate-to-humanitarian-area-in-al-mawasi-where-international-humanitarian-aid-will-be-provided/). IDF claims Hamas fired rockets from Al-Mawasi, including failed launches, as early as December 9, 2023 [IDF Twitter - Rocket claims](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1733542164091523324?lang=en). On January 4, 2024, Hamas reported 14 deaths from an airstrike in Al-Mawasi, but no photos or videos emerged [Hamas statement - Al-Mawasi strike](https://www.hamas.gov.ps/en/post/1234/al-mawasi-incident).

### Reduction in necessary food and medical supplies

## GHF
### What are they?
The [[Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\|Gaza Humanitarian Foundation]] (GHF) is an American nonprofit organization established in February 2025 to distribute humanitarian aid in the [[02. Research Vault/Israel-Palestine/Geographics/Gaza Strip\|Gaza Strip]], with the goal of getting food and supplies to people dealing with the ongoing crisis there. They've distributed over [135 million meals](https://x.com/GHFUpdates/status/1959313153927295484) so far, mostly through sites in places like [[Rafah\|Rafah]] and [[Khan Younis\|Khan Younis]].
### Owner and Funding
GHF is run by Executive Director [[John Acree\|John Acree]], who's been the main face pushing their work and calling for more partners. [[Mike Huckabee\|Mike Huckabee]], the US Ambassador to [[02. Research Vault/Israel-Palestine/Geographics/Israel\|Israel]], has backed them publicly. The US State Department gave them [$30 million](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/state-department-approves-30-million-funding-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-2025-06-26/) directly. 

### GHF Killings
Since GHF started ops on May 26, 2025, there've been reports of at least[ 859 Palestinians killed near their aid sites](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/killings-palestinians-seeking-food-gaza-continue-starvation-deepens-enar), with UN experts saying most were from Israeli military fire while people were just trying to get food, [like 20+ killed in a stampede at one site, where GHF blamed "Hamas-affiliated agitators,"](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-backed-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-says-20-people-killed-crush-2025-07-16/) but witnesses and docs point to Israeli forces or contractors using live ammo and grenades. [[Doctors Without Borders\|Doctors Without Borders]] (MSF) calls these sites ["slaughter masquerading as aid"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/08/shooting-rafah-gaza-food-distribution-point-ghf7) and ["orchestrated killing".](https://news.sky.com/story/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-aid-distributions-have-become-sites-of-orchestrated-killing-charity-claims-13407944) On Twitter, [ITV News](https://x.com/itvnews/status/1956066253220487442?referrer=grok-com) and [others](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1958109381351923935?referrer=grok-com) shared videos of the aftermath.
### Allegations of contaminated aid
There've been reports since June 2025 of GHF aid being contaminated, like flour bags with plastic waste, rubbish, or black mold, making it inedible. Gaza's Government Media Office called out oxycodone (a painkiller) found in some flour on June 27, saying it's like using drugs as a "soft weapon." Parachuted packages were reportedly moldy too. On [Twitter](https://x.com/AJEnglish/status/1952817332490850805?referrer=grok-com), Al Jazeera posted videos of contaminated bags from GHF sites.
