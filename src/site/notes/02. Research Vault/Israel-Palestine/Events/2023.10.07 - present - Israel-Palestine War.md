## Events
### Bombing of the Al-Ahli Hospital 

- On October 17, 2023, news outlets reported a big explosion near Al-Ahli Hospital. Al Jazeera said about 500 people died [Al Jazeera - Photos of Al-Ahli raid](https://web.archive.org/web/20231017204908/https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/10/17/photos-an-israeli-air-raid-on-al-ahli-arab-hospital-kills-an-estimated-500), BBC’s Jeremy Bowen called it a huge blast looking like an Israeli strike [BBC News - Jeremy Bowen report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7T9ZnT-gC4), and Channel 4 questioned Israel’s claim it was a PIJ misfire [Channel 4 - Hospital strike analysis](https://www.mediaite.com/uk/channel-4-news-israel-evidence-gaza-hospital/). NYT also reported around 500 deaths [NYT - Hospital bombing](https://web.archive.org/web/20231017190254/https://www.nytimes.com/).
- Later analysis showed a crater in the parking lot, not the hospital itself, suggesting it wasn’t a big Israeli missile. Human Rights Watch found on November 26, 2023, that it was likely a Palestinian group’s rocket and raised questions about the death toll reported by Hamas [Human Rights Watch - Al-Ahli findings](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/26/gaza-findings-october-17-al-ahli-hospital-explosion).

### Israel bombing "safe zones"

- Reports from UNCHR, HRW, PBS, DOHA News, and VOA News said Israel ordered 1.1 million people to leave northern Gaza in 24 hours, calling it impossible [UNCHR - Evacuation order](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/israel-must-rescind-evacuation-order-northern-gaza-and-comply-international), [HRW - Gaza evacuation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/16/why-israels-gaza-evacuation-order-so-alarming), [PBS - Evacuation news](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-orders-evacuation-of-1-million-in-northern-gaza-in-24-hours), [DOHA News - UN call](https://dohanews.co/un-calls-on-israel-to-rescind-impossible-24-hour-evacuation-order-for-1-million-palestinians/), [VOA News - 24-hour notice](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-un-northern-gaza-should-evacuate-within-24-hours/7309227.html). This came from a UN statement by Stéphane Dujarric [UN Press - Dujarric statement](https://press.un.org/en/2023/db231013.doc.htm).
- Some said Israel bombed southern Gaza after telling people to flee there. On October 13, 2023, Israel dropped pamphlets and posted on social media in Arabic/English warning 1.1 million to leave northern Gaza [IAF - Airdropped warnings](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/hamas-israel-war-october-2023/warning-to-civilians/). No official 24-hour deadline was confirmed; major ground ops started October 27, 2023 [IDF - Operation timeline](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-regarding-the-hamas-israel-war/). No mutual "safe zones" exist as Hamas hasn’t cooperated [IDF - Al-Mawasi declaration](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-regarding-the-hamas-israel-war/october-23-pr/idf-calls-residents-of-gaza-to-evacuate-to-humanitarian-area-in-al-mawasi-where-international-humanitarian-aid-will-be-provided/). Israel declared Al-Mawasi a safe zone on October 18, 2023 [IDF - Al-Mawasi safe zone](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-regarding-the-hamas-israel-war/october-23-pr/idf-calls-residents-of-gaza-to-evacuate-to-humanitarian-area-in-al-mawasi-where-international-humanitarian-aid-will-be-provided/). IDF claims Hamas fired rockets from Al-Mawasi, including failed launches, as early as December 9, 2023 [IDF Twitter - Rocket claims](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1733542164091523324?lang=en). On January 4, 2024, Hamas reported 14 deaths from an airstrike in Al-Mawasi, but no photos or videos emerged [Hamas statement - Al-Mawasi strike](https://www.hamas.gov.ps/en/post/1234/al-mawasi-incident).

### Reduction in required food and medical supplies  
According to reports, fewer trucks are entering Gaza, raising concerns about a lack of food, water, medication, and fuel supplies. Some believe Israel is doing this on purpose as collective punishment. [UN OCHA - Crossing Data](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/crossings).  
- Several sources warned about famine or starvation.

## Israeli Evacuation Zones
---
Since October 13th, 2023, the IDF has ordered mass evacuations from the Gaza Strip, claiming to 'minimize' civilian losses in the conflict. On the 13th, Israel ordered 1.1 million Gazans to relocate to the north of [[Wadi Gaza\|Wadi Gaza]], and some in [[Gaza City\|Gaza City]] to evacuate south within 24 hours. [In December 2023, Israel designated a region in south Gaza as a "humanitarian zone". This zone was later expanded in May 2024 to cover the majority of Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah, and Al-Mawasi.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/israel-ends-mention-of-humanitarian-zones-as-gaza-war-grinds-on). On March 18th, 2025, the IDF ordered evacuations in [northern Gaza and eastern Khan Younis, which affected around 65,000 people.](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-273-gaza-strip)

>[!info]
**Rationale:** Israeli officials said the zones kept civilians out of violence. The IDF said that their warnings and maps were "clear and detailed" and that it targeted militants rather than civilians. [HRW notes Israel alleged the presence of Hamas fighters, weapons caches, and tunnels beneath civilian areas as justification for evacuations.](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/14/hopeless-starving-and-besieged/israels-forced-displacement-palestinians-gaza). In public remarks, the IDF emphasized that it "calls for and facilitates evacuation" from risky regions.
**Humanitarian impact:** The displacement was significant, and by July 2024, aid agencies said [**86% of Gazans**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/29/un-says-86-percent-of-gaza-now-under-israeli-evacuation-orders) has been ordered to relocate.Aid agencies warned that Gaza's roads, fuel, and shelters were inadequately equipped for such movements. [Unicef's executive director, Catherine Russell, stated: "Images of children burning while sheltering in makeshift tents should shake us all to our core."](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrl891j23o)
**Legal and Strategic Outcomes:** Human rights organizations criticized the evacuations. [Amnesty International described them as "cruel and unlawful" forced displacements.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/10/israel-opt-israel-must-rescind-latest-evacuation-orders-for-north-gaza-and-allow-immediate-unhindered-humanitarian-access/). UN agencies reported that **Al-Mawasi, designated by Israel as a humanitarian zone, [had no electricity, water, or infrastructure](https://palestine.un.org/en/297146-gaza-israel-continues-kill-entire-displaced-families-area-it-designated-%E2%80%9Csafe%E2%80%9D)** for the hundreds of thousands of orders there. According to UN sources, between March and June 2025, Israeli strikes killed over 380 civilians (mainly women and children) in al-Mawasi tents, with no viable military targets identified.In total, by mid-2025, the UN calculated that **70% of Gaza's area was under evacuation orders or effectively off-limits to civilians**. [The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) stated that a mass evacuation of Gaza City would be unsafe and impracticable due to the siege conditions](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/evacuation-gaza-city-would-be-unsafe-unfeasible-says-head-red-cross-2025-08-30/).
## Jabalia Refugee Camp
---
On October 31, 2023, Israeli air raids destroyed multiple apartment blocks in Jabalia. According to Hamas health officials, [more than 50 civilians were killed and approximately 150 wounded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/dozens-killed-after-israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-refugee-camp). Video footage documented at least 47 bodies being recovered from the debris while rescue teams continued to search for survivors. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the operation targeted Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari in Jabalia and claimed that civilians had been warned to evacuate to the south in advance. The following year, on October 12, 2024, another residential complex in Jabalia was bombed. The Gaza Health Ministry reported at least 22 Palestinian fatalities and dozens of injuries.

### What are they?
---
The [[Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\|Gaza Humanitarian Foundation]] (GHF) is an American nonprofit organization established in February 2025 to distribute humanitarian aid in the [[02. Research Vault/Israel-Palestine/Geographics/Gaza Strip\|Gaza Strip]], with the goal of getting food and supplies to people dealing with the ongoing crisis there. They've distributed over [135 million meals](https://x.com/GHFUpdates/status/1959313153927295484) so far, mostly through sites in places like [[Rafah\|Rafah]] and [[Khan Younis\|Khan Younis]].
### Owner and Funding
---
GHF is run by Executive Director [[John Acree\|John Acree]], who's been the main face pushing their work and calling for more partners. [[Mike Huckabee\|Mike Huckabee]], the US Ambassador to [[02. Research Vault/Israel-Palestine/Geographics/Israel\|Israel]], has backed them publicly. The US State Department gave them [$30 million](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/state-department-approves-30-million-funding-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-2025-06-26/) directly. 

### GHF Killings
---
Since GHF started ops on May 26, 2025, there've been reports of at least[ 859 Palestinians killed near their aid sites](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/killings-palestinians-seeking-food-gaza-continue-starvation-deepens-enar), with UN experts saying most were from Israeli military fire while people were just trying to get food, [like 20+ killed in a stampede at one site, where GHF blamed "Hamas-affiliated agitators,"](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-backed-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-says-20-people-killed-crush-2025-07-16/) but witnesses and docs point to Israeli forces or contractors using live ammo and grenades. [[Doctors Without Borders\|Doctors Without Borders]] (MSF) calls these sites ["slaughter masquerading as aid"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/08/shooting-rafah-gaza-food-distribution-point-ghf7) and ["orchestrated killing".](https://news.sky.com/story/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-aid-distributions-have-become-sites-of-orchestrated-killing-charity-claims-13407944) On Twitter, [ITV News](https://x.com/itvnews/status/1956066253220487442?referrer=grok-com) and [others](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1958109381351923935?referrer=grok-com) shared videos of the aftermath.
### Allegations of contaminated aid
---
There've been reports since June 2025 of GHF aid being contaminated, like flour bags with plastic waste, rubbish, or black mold, making it inedible. Gaza's Government Media Office called out oxycodone (a painkiller) found in some flour on June 27, saying it's like using drugs as a "soft weapon." Parachuted packages were reportedly moldy too. On [Twitter](https://x.com/AJEnglish/status/1952817332490850805?referrer=grok-com), Al Jazeera posted videos of contaminated bags from GHF sites.
