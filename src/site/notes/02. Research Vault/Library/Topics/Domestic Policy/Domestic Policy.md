- **Economic Uncertainty from Tariffs**: Trump is a "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) when it comes to promises like healthcare and infrastructure, but his tariffs have been disastrous. Inflation increased to 2.7% in July 2025 (up 0.3% from May), with [US Core Inflation rising to 3.1%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/core-inflation-rate), which is directly related to tariffs raising prices. Growth predictions for 2025 have been reduced to 1.4% (down from 2.8% pre-tariffs), raising the possibility of stagflation.

- **Immigration Overreach**: The OBBB spends more than $133 billion on mass deportations, detention centers (116K beds), and border fences, but it is ineffectual and brutal. ICE was already $1 billion over budget pre-bill. Medicaid and food assistance cuts have disproportionately impacted low-income households.
