Trump supporters utilize the talking point of "Biden weaponizing the DOJ" to distract from Donald Trump's mishandling of sensitive materials, which he seized as president and concealed in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom until 2023, when they were discovered during an FBI raid. However, Donald Trump has recently militarized the Department of Justice without the knowledge of his followers. First, he asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to form a "Weaponization Working Group" to investigate and destroy what they call "politicized" cases from the previous administration.
