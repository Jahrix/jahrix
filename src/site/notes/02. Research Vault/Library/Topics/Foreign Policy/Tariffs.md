Trump, a notorious **TACO** (short for ‚ÄòTrump Always Chickens Out‚Äô), has consistently made promises that he fails to deliver. For instance, he has claimed to have a **2-week** plan for his healthcare, infrastructure, and potential TikTok divestment.

- Trump‚Äôs tariffs have had a devastating impact on the US economy. Inflation has risen from 2.4% in May to 3% in the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics research, as reported by [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/).

- Trump has used these tariffs as political leverage. For example, he threatened to impose tariffs on political allies like [Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently serving 27 years on charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 Brazilian election](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-donald-trump-violent-overthrow-coup-plot/). Trump sent a tariff letter to Brazil, stating that their tariff rate would increase to 50% if they did not stop the ‚Äòwitch hunt‚Äô against Bolsonaro. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/RapidResponse47/status/1943043154946457812/photo/1) shows the letter.

In the latest conversation between Trump and Xi, the US agreed to:
- Reduce tariff rates by 10%.
- Delay the maritime USTR 301 fees by a year.
- Suspend new Entity List restrictions for ventures in US tech for a year.

In return, China agreed to:
- ‚ÄúWork very hard to stop the flow‚Äù of fentanyl.
- Pause export controls introduced this month in retaliation to our tariffs.

China also agreed to purchase more US soybeans. How much, though? According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/looming-trump-xi-meeting-revives-hope-us-china-trade-truce-2025-10-29/), soybean purchases will be 12 million tons this year and 25 million tons annually for the next three years. This is still lower than Biden‚Äôs worst year for soybeans in 2024 (27 million metric tons of soybeans). Additionally, this means we will only export about 50% of what we should have exported had no negotiations taken place.
