Trump rode back into the White House on promises of "winning bigly" and "America is BACK," but by mid-2025, it's clear he's fumbling everything. Inflation's ticking up thanks to his tariff wars, global alliances are crumbling, and his domestic policies are hitting the working class hardest.

## Foreign Policy

His "America First" shtick has isolated us, emboldened enemies, and tanked U.S. influence. Global confidence in him is at a pitiful 32% median across 24 countries for handling economic issues, with 67% lacking faith. [Source: Pew Research, June 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/11/confidence-in-trump-to-handle-global-issues/).

Here's the expanded lowdown:

- **Middle East**: Trump failed to enforce the Day 1 Gaza ceasefire, leading to resumed Israeli military ops and more suffering. His pro-Israel tilt without balance has alienated allies and prolonged conflicts. [Source: American Progress, April 2025](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/100-days-of-the-trump-administrations-foreign-policy-global-chaos-american-weakness-and-human-suffering/).

- **Ukraine Betrayal**: His "policy toward Ukraine" is a top failure. Pushing for concessions like "land swapping" with Russia, which reeks of appeasement. He rambled about Russian generals choosing "farmland" routes to Kyiv in pressers, but in reality, he's weakened NATO support, letting Putin gain ground. No U.S. boots? Sure, but his delays have cost lives. [Source: CFR, April 2025](https://www.cfr.org/article/first-100-days-trumps-foreign-policy-disruption-just-beginning).

- **Tariff Wars Hurting Allies**: Slapping 35% tariffs on Canada over fentanyl (despite only 119lbs seized from 2022-2025) and threats to Mexico/China are tanking trade. Economists say this could shrink global growth by 2025. [Source: PIIE Working Paper, June 2025](https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/2025/global-economic-effects-trumps-2025-tariffs); [CBP Stats](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics). He threatened Brazil with 50% tariffs to drop charges against Bolsonaro, meddling in allies' affairs like a bully. [Source: MEI, May 2025](https://www.mei.edu/publications/trumps-diplomatic-failures-russia-cast-pall-over-his-middle-east-efforts); [CBS on Bolsonaro](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-donald-trump-violent-overthrow-coup-plot/).

- **General Chaos**: In his first 100 days, Trump froze trillions in grants/loans illegally, weakening U.S. leverage abroad. He's joined Israel in attacking Iran, contradicting his "no wars" boast. [Source: New Dem Coalition, April 2025](https://newdemocratcoalition.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/100-days-100-disasters-new-dem-leadership-looks-back-on-the-first-chaotic-months-of-the-trump-administration); [Hill Op-Ed, July 2025](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5380124-trumps-failures-are-turning-americans-away-from-him/).

## Domestic Policy

- **Economic Uncertainty from Tariffs**: Trump is a "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) on promises like healthcare/infrastructure, but his tariffs are a disaster. Inflation rose to 2.7% in July 2025 (up 0.3% from May), with [US Core Inflation going up to 3.1%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/core-inflation-rate), directly tied to tariffs boosting prices. Growth forecasts for 2025 are down to 1.4% (vs. 2.8% pre-tariffs), risking stagflation. [Source: BLS CPI, July 2025](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/); [Forbes/CNN, August 2025](https://archive.ph/EwnUs/); [Yale Insights, August 2025](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/trumps-tariff-tantrums-are-hobbling-the-us-economy).

- **Immigration Overreach**: The OBBB funnels $133B+ into mass deportations, detention camps (116K beds), and border walls, but it's ineffective and cruel. ICE was already $1B over budget pre-bill. Cuts to Medicaid/food assistance hit low-income families hard. [Source: Axios, July 2025](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/03/immigration-spending-increases-trump-big-beautiful-bill); [Guardian, July 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/immigration-trump-big-beautiful-bill).

- **Regulatory Rollbacks**: Trump's 186 executive orders (as of August 2025) rescind Biden-era protections, like BLM's NPR-A management for oil favoritism. DOGE is blocked from Treasury systems after court rulings. [Source: Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025); [Brookings Tracker, June 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-regulatory-changes-in-the-second-trump-administration/).

- **DC Takeover Meltdown**: Trump's presser rants about seizing DC police/National Guard contradicting low crime stats. [DC restaurants are actually losing customers despite Trump saying restaurants are busier than ever](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/dc-restaurant-dining-plunges-trumps-crime-crackdown-continues).

- **Personal Waste**: Trump's golfed ~25% of his days in office (51/205 as of July 2025), costing taxpayers $71.4M+. Recent Scotland trip? Another $10M hit. [Source: Guardian, March 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/17/trump-golf-taxes); [Independent, July 2025](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-scotland-golf-taxpayer-turnberry-b2796021.html).

## Truth Test: Trump vs. Biden & Kamala

Trump‚Äôs a serial liar. PolitiFact: 76% misleading/false, 18% Pants on Fire. Biden: 59% accurate, 41% false/misleading. [Source: PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/feb/01/what-politifact-learned-in-1000-fact-checks-of-don/). Fact-checks show Harris‚Äôs claims hold up better than Trump‚Äôs.

## Anti-Kamala/Biden Talking Points

Trump‚Äôs crew spreads these to distract from his flops.

- **‚ÄúGas Prices Are Biden‚Äôs Fault‚Äù**: Nope, global factors like the Russia-Ukraine war spiked them. Biden released reserves; U.S. production hit records. Trump‚Äôs tariffs are the real inflation driver now.

- **‚ÄúTrump Didn‚Äôt Start Any Wars‚Äù**: False. Troops active in multiple spots, drone strikes killed civilians (e.g., Soleimani). Biden handled Trump‚Äôs botched Afghanistan withdrawal.  
  - [Trump's 1st Admin sold 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine in 2018 valued at $47m](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/news-briefs/us-anti-tank-missiles-headed-ukraine).

- **‚ÄúOpen Border?‚Äù**: Biden deported 2.3M+ (more than Trump‚Äôs early years), continued Title 42, and boosted surveillance. Spikes are global, not policy.

- **‚ÄúWhy Didn‚Äôt Kamala Have a Primary?‚Äù**: It ran Jan-Jun 2024; Biden dropped July 21, Harris nominated unopposed at convention.

- **‚ÄúKamala Lost in 2020‚Äù**: Dropped pre-primary, became VP‚Äîno challengers, like Gore/LBJ norms.

## Trump‚Äôs Golf Habit

## Trump's OBBB (One Big Beautiful Bill)

### Full Analysis

The **One Big Beautiful Bill**, signed by President Trump on **Friday, July 4th, 2025**, includes an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement aligned with Trump‚Äôs second-term policy agenda.

> üß® **Spoiler**: The top-line tax breaks sound nice. But when you dig deeper, this bill mostly **benefits the ultra-wealthy and corporations**, while making life harder for working Americans.

## Trump's Tariff Blunder

Trump is a known **TACO**, which stands for '**Trump Always Chickens Out.**' This is completely backed when Trump says **2 weeks**, whether it comes to his 'healthcare plan, infrastructure plan, and potential TikTok divestment.

- Donald Trump has used these tariffs as threats for political pressure such as to free political allies such as [Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently on trial on charges of trying to overturn the 2022 Brazilian election](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-donald-trump-violent-overthrow-coup-plot/), [sending out a tariff letter and saying Brazil's tariff rate is now 50% if they do not stop this 'witch hunt' of Bolsonaro](https://twitter.com/RapidResponse47/status/1943043154946457812/photo/1).
