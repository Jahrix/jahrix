Trump's team/Conservative influencers distributes these talking points to divert attention away from his failures.  
  
- **"Gas Prices Are Biden's Fault"**: No, global events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict exacerbated them. Biden released reserves, and US production surpassed previous records. Trump's tariffs are currently the primary driver of inflation. 

- **"Biden/Harris caused record inflation and wrecked the economy"**
     TrumpÂ supportersÂ enjoyÂ assertingÂ thatÂ Biden and HarrisÂ destroyedÂ the economyÂ throughÂ inflation, a "winningÂ topic"Â heÂ capitalizedÂ onÂ forÂ success.Â  Indeed,Â inflationÂ reachedÂ aÂ highÂ of [9.1% in June 2022](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/), but that wasÂ dueÂ toÂ worldwideÂ turmoil, COVIDÂ recovery and the Russia-Ukraine WarÂ droveÂ prices upÂ globally,Â notÂ solelyÂ in the U.S.Â By May 2023,Â asÂ COVIDÂ stopped being a globalÂ emergencyÂ concern and inflationÂ graduallyÂ decreasedÂ from 9.1% to 3% 
         Fast forward toÂ 2025. DueÂ to Trumpâ€™s tariffs,Â inflationÂ hasÂ risenÂ to [2.9%](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) whileÂ core ratesÂ standÂ at [3.1%.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi)

- **"Biden's family is grifters"**
    - Jared Kushner
    Jared owns EA
    - Eric & Don Jr

- **"Trump Didn't Start Any Wars"** is false. Troops were deployed in numerous locations, and drone strikes killed civilians (e.g., Soleimani). Biden oversaw Trump's failed Afghanistan withdrawal.  
    - [In 2018, the Trump administration supplied 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine for $47 million.](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/news-briefs/us-anti-tank-missiles-headed-ukraine).  
  
- "**Open Border?"**: Biden deported more than 2.3 million people (more than Trump in his early years), maintained Title 42, and increased monitoring. Spikes are global in nature, not policy-related.  
  
- **"Why Didn't Kamala Have a Primary?"**: The Democratic PrimaryÂ spanned from January to June 2024; Biden dropped out on July 21, while Harris was nominated unchallenged at the convention.  
    - **"Kamala Lost in 2020"**: Biden dropped pre-primary and became VPâ€”no opponents, as per Gore/LBJ norms.
