Trump came to the White House promising "winning bigly" and "America is BACK," but by September 2025, it's clear he's mismanaging everything. Inflation is growing as a result of his trade wars, global alliances are disintegrating, and his domestic policies are disproportionately hitting the working class.

## Foreign Policy  
---  
His "America First" rhetoric has isolated us, encouraged adversaries, and weakened US influence. Global confidence in him to handle economic difficulties is a pathetic 32% across 24 countries, with 67% lacking faith. [Source: Pew Research, June 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/11/trust-in-trump-to-manage-global-issues/).

Here is the enlarged lowdown:  
  
- **Middle East**: Trump failed to implement the Day 1 Gaza truce, resulting in renewed Israeli military operations and more suffering. His unbalanced pro-Israel stance has alienated allies and fueled conflict. [Source: American Progress, April 2025](http://www.americanprogress.org/article/100-days-of-the-trump-administrations-foreign-policy-global-chaos-american-weakness-and-human-suffering/).  
  
- **Ukraine Betrayal**: His "policy toward Ukraine" is an abject failure. Pushing for concessions like "land swapping" with Russia, which smacks of appeasement. He rambled about Russian generals taking "farmland" approaches to Kyiv in news conferences, but in reality, he has undermined NATO backing, allowing Putin to gain ground. No U.S. boots? Yes, but his delays have cost lives. [Source: CFR, April 2025](https://www.cfr.org/article/first-100-days-trumps-foreign-policy-disruption-is-just-starting).  
  
- **Tariff Wars Hurting Allies**: Imposing 35% tariffs on Canada for fentanyl (despite only 119lbs confiscated between 2022 and 2025) and threats against Mexico and China are stifling commerce. Economists believe this could slow global development by 2025. [Source: PIIE Working Paper, June 2025](https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/2025/global-economic-effects-trumps-2025-tariffs) and [CBP Stats](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics). He threatened Brazil with 50% tariffs if it dropped charges against Bolsonaro, intervening in the affairs of allies like a bully.

- **General Chaos**: During his first 100 days, Trump illegally froze trillions of dollars in grants and loans, reducing the United States' international leverage. He has joined Israel in bombing Iran, violating his "no wars" claim. [Source: New Democrat Coalition, April 2025](https://newdemocratcoalition.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/100-days-100-disasters-new-dem-leadership-looks-back-on-the-first-chaotic-months-of-the-trump-administration); [Hill Op-Ed, July 2025](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5380124-trumps-failures-are-turning-americans-away-from-him/).
## ## Domestic Policy 
---  
- **Economic Uncertainty from Tariffs**: Trump is a "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) when it comes to promises like healthcare and infrastructure, but his tariffs have been disastrous. Inflation increased to 2.7% in July 2025 (up 0.3% from May), with [US Core Inflation rising to 3.1%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/core-inflation-rate), which is directly related to tariffs raising prices. Growth predictions for 2025 have been reduced to 1.4% (down from 2.8% pre-tariffs), raising the possibility of stagflation. [Source: BLS CPI, July 2025](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/); [Forbes/CNN, August 2025](https://archive.ph/EwnUs/); [Yale Insights, August 2025](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/trumps-tariff-tantrums-are-hobbling-the-us-economy).  
  
- **Immigration Overreach**: The OBBB spends more than $133 billion on mass deportations, detention centers (116K beds), and border fences, but it is ineffectual and brutal. ICE was already $1 billion over budget pre-bill. Medicaid and food assistance cuts have disproportionately impacted low-income households. [Source: Axios, July 2025](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/03/immigrant-spending-increases-trump-big-beautiful-bill); [Guardian, July 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/immigration-trump-big-beautiful-bill).  
  
- **Regulatory Rollbacks**: Trump's 186 executive orders (as of August 2025) reverse Biden-era protections, such as the BLM's NPR-A management for oil favoring. DOGE has been prohibited from Treasury systems following court orders. [Source: Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025) and [Brookings Tracker, June 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-regulatory-changes-in-the-second-trump-administration/).  
  
- **DC Takeover**: Trump's presser screams about snatching DC police and the National Guard, contradicting low crime statistics. [DC restaurants are actually losing customers, despite Trump's claims that they are busier than ever](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/dc-restaurant-dining-plunges-trumps-crime-crackdown-continues).  
  
- **Personal Waste**: Trump golfed approximately 25% of his days in office (51/205 as of July 2025), spending taxpayers $71.4 million+. Has anyone recently visited Scotland? Another $10 million hit. [Source: The Guardian, March 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/17/trump-golf-taxes); [Independent, July 2025](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-scotland-golf-taxpayer-turnberry-b2796021.html).

## Truth Test: Trump vs. Biden and Kamala
---
Trump is a serial liar. PolitiFact: 76% misleading or false, 18% pants on fire. Biden: 59% accurate, 41% incorrect or misleading. [Source: PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/feb/01/what-politifact-learned-from-1000-fact-checks-of-don/). Fact-checking reveals that Harris' statements hold up better than Trump's. [FactCheck.org, July 2024](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/07/factchecking-vice-president-kamala-harris).
## Anti-Kamala/Biden Talking Points
---
Trump's team/Conservative influencers distributes these talking points to divert attention away from his failures.  
  
- **"Gas Prices Are Biden's Fault"**: No, global events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict exacerbated them. Biden released reserves, and US production surpassed previous records. Trump's tariffs are currently the primary driver of inflation.  
  
- **"Trump Didn't Start Any Wars"** is false. Troops were deployed in numerous locations, and drone strikes killed civilians (e.g., Soleimani). Biden oversaw Trump's failed Afghanistan withdrawal.  
    - [In 2018, the Trump administration supplied 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine for $47 million.](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/news-briefs/us-anti-tank-missiles-headed-ukraine).  
  
- "**Open Border?"**: Biden deported more than 2.3 million people (more than Trump in his early years), maintained Title 42, and increased monitoring. Spikes are global in nature, not policy-related.  
  
- **"Why Didn't Kamala Have a Primary?"**: The Democratic Primary spanned from January to June 2024; Biden dropped out on July 21, while Harris was nominated unchallenged at the convention.  
    - **"Kamala Lost in 2020"**: Biden dropped pre-primary and became VP—no opponents, as per Gore/LBJ norms.
## Trump’s Golf Habit

As of September 1st, 2025, Trump has spent 57 out of his 224 days in office **(~25.4%)** playing golf. That’s **$79.8 million** in taxpayer costs.

 The top-line tax breaks seem like a good idea. However, a closer look reveals that this measure primarily **helps businesses and the ultra-wealthy** while making life more difficult for working Americans.

Counting the ❌ BADs, this measure is a net loss for the bottom 95%, with transitory bonuses compensated by tariffs and permanent losses. I believe this is a complete sham.

## Trump's Tariff Blunder

Trump is a known **TACO**, which stands for '**Trump Always Chickens Out.**' This is completely backed when Trump claims **2 weeks**, whether it comes to his 'healthcare plan, infrastructure plan, and potential TikTok divestment.

## Politicization of the DOJ
---
Trump supporters utilize the talking point of "Biden weaponizing the DOJ" to distract from Donald Trump's mishandling of sensitive materials, which he seized as president and concealed in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom until 2023, when they were discovered during an FBI raid. However, Donald Trump has recently militarized the Department of Justice without the knowledge of his followers. First, he asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to form a "Weaponization Working Group" to investigate and destroy what they call "politicized" cases from the previous administration.

Here’s the breakdown:

- **Targeting Political Opponents**: [Bondi's DOJ launched investigations against the New York Attorney General's office and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) over potential mortgage fraud.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-opens-investigation-new-york-ags-office-brought-fraud-case-trump-rcna223731)  
  
- **Dismissing Cases**: [Bondi dismissed Biden-era cases, including one against Georgia's voting regulations, claiming it ended "weaponized litigation" while shielding Trump's backers.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-dismisses-biden-era-lawsuit-against-commonsense-georgia)  
  
- **Reviewing Trump's Prosecutions**: [She ordered a review of federal cases against Trump with the goal of overhauling the agency and halting pending investigations.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/bondi-orders-review-of-trump-cases-after-being-sworn-in-as-attorney-general)  
  
- **Attack on the Judiciary**: [Bondi filed a misconduct complaint against Judge James Boasberg, who supervises cases against the Trump administration, intensifying attacks on independent judges.](https://apnews.com/article/boasberg-salvador-venezuela-trump-misconduct-complaint-b5f5e982263b95f32e4229aefe312f12)
 
- **Partisan Cover-Ups**: [In order to shield party members and pursue Democrats, Bondi disregarded the Signal chat controversy involving Republican officials.](https://san.com/media-miss/attorney-general-bondi-downplays-need-for-signal-chat-probe-as-lawmakers-push-for-investigation/)

## Failure of Mass Deportations (soon)
---
Immigration was a winning topic for the Second Trump Administration (according to an [AP-NORC poll](https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-economy-poll-inflation-dc80ac9e5d7da42900762910d5f0a283)). Their whole tagline included examples of migrant criminality and the term 'MASS DEPORTATIONS NOW'. There are 14-15 million undocumented migrants (actual. [14 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2025/08/21/u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-population-reached-a-record-14-million-in-2023/)) in the United States. T
