Trump returned to the White House promising "winning bigly" and "America is BACK," but by September 2025, it's evident he's mishandling everything. Inflation is rising as a result of his trade conflicts, global alliances are collapsing, and his domestic policies are disproportionately affecting the working class.

## Foreign Policy

His "America First" shtick has isolated us, emboldened enemies, and tanked U.S. influence. Global confidence in him is at a pitiful 32% median across 24 countries for handling economic issues, with 67% lacking faith. [Source: Pew Research, June 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/11/confidence-in-trump-to-handle-global-issues/).

Here's the expanded lowdown:

- **Middle East**: Trump failed to enforce the Day 1 Gaza ceasefire, leading to resumed Israeli military ops and more suffering. His pro-Israel tilt without balance has alienated allies and prolonged conflicts. [Source: American Progress, April 2025](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/100-days-of-the-trump-administrations-foreign-policy-global-chaos-american-weakness-and-human-suffering/).

- **Ukraine Betrayal**: His "policy toward Ukraine" is a top failure. Pushing for concessions like "land swapping" with Russia, which reeks of appeasement. He rambled about Russian generals choosing "farmland" routes to Kyiv in pressers, but in reality, he's weakened NATO support, letting Putin gain ground. No U.S. boots? Sure, but his delays have cost lives. [Source: CFR, April 2025](https://www.cfr.org/article/first-100-days-trumps-foreign-policy-disruption-just-beginning).

- **Tariff Wars Hurting Allies**: Slapping 35% tariffs on Canada over fentanyl (despite only 119lbs seized from 2022-2025) and threats to Mexico/China are tanking trade. Economists say this could shrink global growth by 2025. [Source: PIIE Working Paper, June 2025](https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/2025/global-economic-effects-trumps-2025-tariffs); [CBP Stats](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics). He threatened Brazil with 50% tariffs to drop charges against Bolsonaro, meddling in allies' affairs like a bully. [Source: MEI, May 2025](https://www.mei.edu/publications/trumps-diplomatic-failures-russia-cast-pall-over-his-middle-east-efforts); [CBS on Bolsonaro](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-donald-trump-violent-overthrow-coup-plot/).

- **General Chaos**: In his first 100 days, Trump froze trillions in grants/loans illegally, weakening U.S. leverage abroad. He's joined Israel in attacking Iran, contradicting his "no wars" boast. [Source: New Dem Coalition, April 2025](https://newdemocratcoalition.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/100-days-100-disasters-new-dem-leadership-looks-back-on-the-first-chaotic-months-of-the-trump-administration); [Hill Op-Ed, July 2025](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5380124-trumps-failures-are-turning-americans-away-from-him/).

## Domestic Policy

- **Economic Uncertainty from Tariffs**: Trump is a "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) on promises like healthcare/infrastructure, but his tariffs are a disaster. Inflation rose to 2.7% in July 2025 (up 0.3% from May), with [US Core Inflation going up to 3.1%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/core-inflation-rate), directly tied to tariffs boosting prices. Growth forecasts for 2025 are down to 1.4% (vs. 2.8% pre-tariffs), risking stagflation. [Source: BLS CPI, July 2025](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/); [Forbes/CNN, August 2025](https://archive.ph/EwnUs/); [Yale Insights, August 2025](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/trumps-tariff-tantrums-are-hobbling-the-us-economy).

- **Immigration Overreach**: The OBBB funnels $133B+ into mass deportations, detention camps (116K beds), and border walls, but it's ineffective and cruel. ICE was already $1B over budget pre-bill. Cuts to Medicaid/food assistance hit low-income families hard. [Source: Axios, July 2025](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/03/immigration-spending-increases-trump-big-beautiful-bill); [Guardian, July 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/immigration-trump-big-beautiful-bill).

- **Regulatory Rollbacks**: Trump's 186 executive orders (as of August 2025) rescind Biden-era protections, like BLM's NPR-A management for oil favoritism. DOGE is blocked from Treasury systems after court rulings. [Source: Federal Register, 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025); [Brookings Tracker, June 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-regulatory-changes-in-the-second-trump-administration/).

- **DC Takeover Meltdown**: Trump's presser rants about seizing DC police/National Guard contradicting low crime stats. [DC restaurants are actually losing customers despite Trump saying restaurants are busier than ever](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/dc-restaurant-dining-plunges-trumps-crime-crackdown-continues).

- **Personal Waste**: Trump's golfed ~25% of his days in office (51/205 as of July 2025), costing taxpayers $71.4M+. Recent Scotland trip? Another $10M hit. [Source: Guardian, March 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/17/trump-golf-taxes); [Independent, July 2025](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-scotland-golf-taxpayer-turnberry-b2796021.html).

## Truth Test: Trump vs. Biden & Kamala

Trump‚Äôs a serial liar. PolitiFact: 76% misleading/false, 18% Pants on Fire. Biden: 59% accurate, 41% false/misleading. [Source: PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/feb/01/what-politifact-learned-in-1000-fact-checks-of-don/). Fact-checks show Harris‚Äôs claims hold up better than Trump‚Äôs.

## Anti-Kamala/Biden Talking Points  
  
Trump's team/Conservative influencers distributes these talking points to divert attention away from his failures.  
  
- **"Gas Prices Are Biden's Fault"**: No, global events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict exacerbated them. Biden released reserves, and US production surpassed previous records. Trump's tariffs are currently the primary driver of inflation.  
  
- **"Trump Didn't Start Any Wars"** is false. Troops were deployed in numerous locations, and drone strikes killed civilians (e.g., Soleimani). Biden oversaw Trump's failed Afghanistan withdrawal.  
    - [In 2018, the Trump administration supplied 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine for $47 million.](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/news-briefs/us-anti-tank-missiles-headed-ukraine).  
  
- "**Open Border?"**: Biden deported more than 2.3 million people (more than Trump in his early years), maintained Title 42, and increased monitoring. Spikes are global in nature, not policy-related.  
  
- **"Why Didn't Kamala Have a Primary?"**: The Democratic Primary¬†spanned from January to June 2024; Biden dropped out on July 21, while Harris was nominated unchallenged at the convention.  
    - **"Kamala Lost in 2020"**: Biden dropped pre-primary and became VP‚Äîno opponents, as per Gore/LBJ norms.

## Trump‚Äôs Golf Habit

As of September 1st, 2025, Trump has spent 57 out of his 224 days in office **(~25.4%)** playing golf. That‚Äôs **$79.8 million** in taxpayer costs.

## Politicization of the DOJ
Trump supporters utilize the talking point of "Biden weaponizing the DOJ" to distract from Donald Trump's mishandling of sensitive materials, which he seized as president and concealed in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom until 2023, when they were discovered during an FBI raid. However, Donald Trump has recently militarized the Department of Justice without the knowledge of his followers. First, he asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to form a "Weaponization Working Group" to investigate and destroy what they call "politicized" cases from the previous administration.
