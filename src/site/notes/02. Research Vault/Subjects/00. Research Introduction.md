This is the gateway to my research archive, where I build the case against Trump and the GOP with hard data and progressive fire. I’m Jahmeer Jones, aka Jahrix, and this vault powers my YouTube content and debates. My current manifesto, [The Anti-Republican Manifesto]([[02. Research Vault/Manifestos/The Anti-Republican Manifesto\|The Anti-Republican Manifesto]]), drives my work, exposing Trump’s 2025 failures as of August 14, 2025. My take: He’s a fraud, and we’re tearing it apart. Link to [[04. Meta/About\|About]] for the full mission.
