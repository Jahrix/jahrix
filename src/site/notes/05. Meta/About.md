# # 👋 Welcome to Jahmeer Jones’ Research Archive

Welcome to my personal knowledge vault. This is where I track, build, and refine every topic I’m exploring — from political strategy to cultural commentary.

Curated by **Jahmeer Jones** — aka [**Jahrix**](https://www.youtube.com/@JahrixYT) — this space serves as the **central brain** behind my debates, streams, and long-form video work. It’s designed for clarity, receipts, and real-time referencing.
