## 👋 Welcome to Jahmeer Jones’ Research Archive

Welcome to my personal knowledge vault. This is where I <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">track</span>, <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">build</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">refine every topic I’m exploring</span>, from <span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">political strategy</span> to <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">cultural commentary</span>.

Curated by **Jahmeer Jones** — aka [**Jahrix**](https://www.youtube.com/@JahrixYT) — this space serves as the **central brain** behind my debates, streams, and long-form video work. It’s designed for clarity, receipts, and real-time referencing.

## 🧠 Quote of the Week

> Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.”
